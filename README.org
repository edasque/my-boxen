* My Boxen

  This is how I setup my personal boxen.

  I start with a single puppet file: =jedcn.pp=.

** jedcn.pp

   This file declares =people::jedcn=. This knows how to include
   everything, but doesn't know anything on its own.

   #+BEGIN_SRC puppet :tangle ./modules/people/manifests/jedcn.pp :padline no
     class people::jedcn {
       include people::jedcn::applications
       include people::jedcn::git
       include people::jedcn::homebrew
       include people::jedcn::links
       include people::jedcn::osx_config
       include people::jedcn::repositories
     }
   #+END_SRC

** applications.pp

   This file declares =people::jedcn::applications=.

   This pulls in the non-homebrew applications that I use.

*** Browsers

    I use the standard browsers, and I use Slate for Window
    Management.

    I found that I had to manually launch slate and allow it access
    to control my accessibility devices. This was a matter of
    following prompts.

    #+BEGIN_SRC puppet :tangle ./modules/people/manifests/jedcn/applications.pp :padline no
      class people::jedcn::applications {
        include chrome
        include chrome::canary
        include slate
      }
    #+END_SRC
